1. 
Why does this assignment ask you to create a function for messages but an action for sending the SMS message?
What's the difference? 
The difference between a function and an action is whether it will cause side-effect or change the state. 
In this lab, we use defaction(action) when we send the message in the module. We can interpret that it essentaily changes the states for the database that stores the message.
However, when we get a list of message, we didn't change any states and that's why we use function.

2. 
Why did we introduce the secrets for the Twilio module by configuring the rule that uses the module, rather than configuring the module directly?
Because we don't want the possibilty of leaking the credentials. We don't want the credentails to be stored on Github or any repositories. 
It is always a bad practice to hard-code the credentails.
